## Theorem

For a permutation $a=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ of $[n]$, let

$$
c(a)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathbf{1}_{\gcd(a_i,a_{i+1})=1},\qquad
h(n)=\min_{a\in S_n}c(a).
$$

Write $\pi(x)$ for the number of primes at most the real number $x$ and set

$$
A_n=\pi(n)-\pi(n/2),\qquad
B_n=\pi(n/2)-\pi(n/3).
$$

**Theorem.** For **every $n\ge4$**,

$$
\boxed{h(n)=A_n+\max\left(1,\left\lceil\frac{B_n}{2}\right\rceil\right)}.
$$

For the remaining cases $h(1)=0,\ h(2)=1,\ h(3)=2$.

In particular the prime number theorem gives

$$
\boxed{h(n)\sim \frac7{12}\frac{n}{\log n}}\qquad(n\to\infty).
$$

This exact formula is proved by a constructive path cover in a noncoprime graph. The first independent computation tests all $12\le n\le10\,000$, with sampled full witness checking, and exact elementary small-case witnesses cover $4\le n\le11$. None of those finite tests substitutes for the proof.

## Step 1 — Graph equivalence and lower bound

Let $H_n$ have vertex set $[n]$, with $\{u,v\}$ an edge iff $u\ne v$ and $\gcd(u,v)>1$. Let $\mathrm{pc}(H_n)$ be the least number of **vertex-disjoint paths covering all vertices**, allowing singleton paths. Cutting a permutation immediately after every coprime adjacent pair produces $c(a)+1$ paths in $H_n$; conversely concatenating any path cover produces at most $k-1$ coprime adjacencies if the cover has $k$ components. Thus

$$
h(n)=\mathrm{pc}(H_n)-1.
$$

For $n\ge4$, vertex 1 and every prime $p\in(n/2,n]$ are **isolated** in $H_n$: there are $A_n+1$ such vertices. The set of remaining nonisolated vertices is nonempty (it contains 2 and 4), and hence requires at least one further path.

Every prime $q\in(n/3,n/2]$ has precisely one neighbor in $H_n$, namely $2q$; these are $B_n$ distinct degree-one vertices. Any path can have **at most two** degree-one vertices, both as endpoints. Such leaves cannot lie in the paths for the isolated vertices. Therefore

$$
\mathrm{pc}(H_n)\ge A_n+1+\max\{1,\lceil B_n/2\rceil\},
$$

or

$$
h(n)\ge A_n+\max\{1,\lceil B_n/2\rceil\}. \tag{1}
$$

## Step 2 — Partition by largest prime factor

For each prime $p\le n$ let

$$
C_p=\{m\in\{2,\ldots,n\}:P^+(m)=p\},
$$

where $P^+(m)$ is the largest prime factor of $m$. These classes partition $\{2,\ldots,n\}$, and each $C_p$ induces a clique in $H_n$, because every member is divisible by $p$.

Partition the primes into four ranges:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
S:\ p\le n/4,&s=|S|=\pi(n/4),\\
M:\ n/4<p\le n/3,&m=|M|,\\
L:\ n/3<p\le n/2,&\ell=|L|=B_n,\\
I:\ n/2<p\le n,&|I|=A_n.
\end{array}
$$

We assume $n\ge12$. Then the following statements hold.

* Every $p\in S$ has **two distinct even vertices** $2p,4p$ in $C_p$; the class can be arranged as a path starting at $2p$ and ending at $4p$. For $p=2$ these vertices are 4 and 8 and are still present.
* For $p\in M$, one has $C_p=\{p,2p,3p\}$. Indeed $n/4<p\le n/3$ implies $3\le n/p<4$; also $p\ge5$, so 2 and 3 are smaller than $p$. The class can be ordered from the **even** endpoint $2p$ to the **multiple-of-three** endpoint $3p$.
* For $p\in L$, $C_p=\{p,2p\}$, with just one even endpoint $2p$.
* For $p\in I$, $C_p=\{p\}$, isolated.

## Step 3 — Form units with two even endpoints

**If $m$ is even:** pair the primes of $M$ arbitrarily. For each pair $p,q$, concatenate the $C_p$-path $2p,\ldots,3p$ with the $C_q$-path $3q,\ldots,2q$. The bridge $3p\!-\!3q$ is valid in $H_n$ because both endpoints are divisible by 3. This creates one path whose **two endpoints are even**.

**If $m$ is odd:** first remove one prime $p$ from $M$ and pair the remaining $m-1$ primes as above. Merge its class $C_p$ with the special small-prime class $C_3$. The class $C_3$ contains both 6 and 9 since $n\ge12$, and can be ordered from 6 to 9. Appending the path $3p,\ldots,2p$ via the bridge $9\!-\!3p$ produces a path from **even** vertex 6 to **even** vertex $2p$, since both $9$ and $3p$ are multiples of 3. Remove $C_3$ from the list of remaining small classes; it has been used exactly once.

All other small classes become individual paths with even endpoints $2p,4p$. Thus every vertex belonging to some class with $p\le n/3$ has been covered by one of exactly

$$
u=s+\lfloor m/2\rfloor
$$

vertex-disjoint paths with **both endpoints even**. (In the odd case, the leftover $M$ class merges with $C_3$, so the count remains $u=s+\lfloor m/2\rfloor$.)

## Step 4 — Attach the one-ended classes

Let

$$
r=\max\{1,\lceil\ell/2\rceil\}.
$$

We require at least $r$ two-even-ended units. In fact $u\ge s\ge r$ for every $n\ge12$.

For the last inequality, use the classical prime-counting inequality

$$
\pi(2x)\le 2\pi(x)\qquad (x\ge3).
$$

It is included in the known Rosser–Schoenfeld bounds for $x>10$ and can be checked directly on $3\le x\le10$; see [OEIS A060208](https://oeis.org/A060208) and its Rosser–Schoenfeld reference. Taking $x=n/4$ yields

$$
\ell=B_n\le \pi(n/2)\le2\pi(n/4)=2s.
$$

Since $s\ge1$, we obtain $r\le s\le u$.

Partition these $u$ two-even-ended units into exactly $r$ nonempty groups, and concatenate the units in each group. All inter-unit edges connect **even to even**, hence are edges of $H_n$. This yields $r$ paths with two even endpoints, covering precisely the classes with $p\le n/3$.

There are $\ell=B_n$ classes $C_p=\{p,2p\}$ with $p\in L$. Each such path has exactly one even endpoint, so it can be **attached at an end** of one of the $r$ existing paths via an even–even edge. Since $\ell\le2r$, assign at most two such attachments per path, one on each end.

All integers with largest prime factor at most $n/2$ are now covered by **exactly $r$** paths. Add $A_n$ singleton classes for $p>n/2$ and the singleton vertex 1. We obtain a path cover of $H_n$ with

$$
r+A_n+1
$$

paths. Hence

$$
h(n)\le A_n+r. \tag{2}
$$

Together with (1), this proves the theorem for **every $n\ge12$**. $\square$

## Step 5 — Direct finite check for $4\le n\le11$

The following explicit permutations achieve the lower bound (1). Each listed count can be checked directly by applying gcd to adjacent entries; no solver is needed.

| $n$ | Optimal permutation | $h(n)$ |
|---:|---|---:|
| 4 | 1,2,4,3 | 2 |
| 5 | 1,2,4,3,5 | 3 |
| 6 | 1,2,4,6,3,5 | 2 |
| 7 | 1,2,4,6,3,5,7 | 3 |
| 8 | 1,2,4,8,6,3,5,7 | 3 |
| 9 | 1,2,4,8,6,3,9,5,7 | 3 |
| 10 | 1,3,9,6,2,4,8,10,5,7 | 2 |
| 11 | 1,3,9,6,2,4,8,10,5,7,11 | 3 |

This completes the exact all-$n$ proof.

## Corollary and interpretation

By the prime number theorem,

$$
A_n=(1/2+o(1))\,n/\log n,
\qquad B_n=(1/6+o(1))\,n/\log n.
$$

Therefore $h(n)=(7/12+o(1))n/\log n$. This also identifies the *entire* optimal path-cover number:

$$
\mathrm{pc}(H_n)=h(n)+1.
$$

The earlier small cases $n=9$ and $n=21$, which were previously described as exceptions to the leaf-prime lower bound, are explained exactly by the extra $\max\{1,\cdot\}$ term. There are no exceptions to the corrected formula for $n\ge4$.

## Reproducibility

[The independent standard-library witness generator](../experiments/P010_construct_optimal_permutation.py) implements this construction and verifies gcd values and optimality against the formula. Finite trials of the construction succeeded for all $12\le n\le10{,}000$; extensive direct checks of the resulting paths were made for the smaller instances and sampled larger cases. This program is a sanity check, not a formal proof.

## Novelty and historical audit

The theorem has a complete proof in this repository. Its historical priority has not been determined. No exact predecessor was found in searches for "fewest coprime adjacent pairs permutation", "maximum noncoprime adjacent pairs", "path cover of noncoprime graph", the $7/12$ constant, or the explicit prime-counting formula. That does **not** rule out earlier proofs using different names.

Most important historical antecedents:

1. **P. Erdős, R. Freud and N. Hegyvári**, *Arithmetical properties of permutations of integers*, *Acta Math. Hung.* 41 (1983), 169–176: https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1983-02.pdf . They study the sizes of consecutive gcd and lcm values, **not in the located statements** the minimum number of gcd-one adjacencies.
2. **Rosser and Schoenfeld** prime-counting inequality $\pi(2x)\le2\pi(x)$ for $x\ge3$; see [OEIS A060208](https://oeis.org/A060208) and https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1738347/proving-that-pi2x-2-pix (which cites the bounds). A self-contained citation/verification of the small range $3\le x\le10$ is included above.
3. Standard graph-theoretic *minimum path cover* is known and not claimed new. The theorem exploits the **special arithmetic partition** by largest prime divisor.

**Provisional resolution:** P010's exact mathematics is resolved within this project, **subject to an adversarial independent proof check and historical novelty verification**. The P010 problem ID is preserved; do not create P011 as a replacement.
