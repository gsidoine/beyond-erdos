# Interval-sum bipartite graphs always have minimum-degree factors

**Status:** Full constructive proof developed within the Meta Erdős project, 2026-10-29. **Novelty is unverified.** This is a resolved incubator theorem, not a new numbered problem and **not** a proof of P003.

## Theorem

Let \(n\ge1\) and let \(a\le b\) be integers. Write \(G_{n;a,b}\) for the bipartite graph with a row class \(R=\{r_0,\dots,r_{n-1}\}\) and a column class \(C=\{c_0,\dots,c_{n-1}\}\), where
\[
r_i c_j\in E(G_{n;a,b})\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a\le i+j\le b.
\]
If \(\lambda(G)\) is the maximum number of **pairwise edge-disjoint perfect matchings** and \(\delta(G)\) the minimum vertex degree, then
\[
\boxed{\lambda(G_{n;a,b})=\delta(G_{n;a,b}).}
\]
Equivalently, \(G_{n;a,b}\) contains a spanning \(\delta(G_{n;a,b})\)-regular subgraph.

The result is trivial if \(\delta=0\), so the proof below treats \(\delta\ge1\).

## Step 1: reverse one bipartition to obtain a band matrix

Truncate \([a,b]\) to \([0,2n-2]\), which does not change the graph. If \(n-1\notin[a,b]\), then either \(r_0\) or \(r_{n-1}\) is isolated and \(\delta=0\). Otherwise put
\[
u=n-1-a,\qquad v=b-(n-1),\qquad
k=\min\{n,u+1,v+1\}.
\]

After reversing column indices \(j\mapsto n-1-j\), the edge condition becomes
\[
-u\le i-j\le v.
\]
The minimum degree in this graph is exactly \(k\): its row/column neighborhoods are intersections of an integer interval of length \(u+v+1\) with \([0,n-1]\); the smallest are at the boundary rows/columns, with endpoint degrees \(\min(n,u+1)\) and \(\min(n,v+1)\).

Because \(k-1\le\min(u,v)\), the reversed graph contains the **symmetric band graph**
\[
B_{n,k}:=\{(i,j):0\le i,j<n,\ |i-j|\le k-1\}.
\]
Its own minimum degree is \(k\). We will explicitly construct a spanning \(k\)-factor of \(B_{n,k}\).

## Step 2: the block lemma

**Lemma.** For every pair of integers \(n\ge k\ge1\), the bipartite graph \(B_{n,k}\) contains a spanning \(k\)-regular subgraph.

**Proof.** Write \(n=qk+r\), where \(q\ge1\) and \(0\le r<k\). Partition each vertex class into the **same consecutive blocks** of sizes
\[
\underbrace{k,\ldots,k}_{q-1\text{ blocks}},\quad k+r.
\]
Build the subgraph separately inside each aligned block; no selected edge joins different blocks.

For a block of size \(k\), retain all \(k^2\) edges. Every selected edge has index displacement at most \(k-1\) and every vertex has degree \(k\).

It remains to handle the final block of size \(m=k+r\). Index its two sides by \(0,\ldots,m-1\), and begin with two edge sets:
\[
E_1=\{(i,j):0\le i<k,\ 0\le j<k\},\qquad
E_2=\{(i,j):k\le i<k+r,\ r\le j<k+r\}.
\]
Each of the first \(k\) rows is incident to exactly \(k\) edges of \(E_1\), and each of the last \(r\) rows is incident to exactly \(k\) edges of \(E_2\). All edges lie within the band \(|i-j|\le k-1\).

Column degrees are initially:
- \(k\) in columns \(0,\ldots,r-1\);
- \(k+r\) in columns \(r,\ldots,k-1\);
- \(r\) in columns \(k,\ldots,k+r-1\).

For **each** pair of integers \(0\le t<r\), \(0\le s<k-r\), perform the edge exchange
\[
\boxed{
(t+s+1,\ r+s)\ \longmapsto\ (t+s+1,\ k+t).
}
\]
The removed edge belongs to \(E_1\) since \(1\le t+s+1\le k-1\), \(r\le r+s\le k-1\). The added edge belongs to the band since
\[
|(k+t)-(t+s+1)|=k-s-1\le k-1.
\]
Every removed edge is distinct and every added edge is distinct and was not present initially. Each exchange preserves the degree of its row.

For a fixed old column \(r+s\), the \(r\) values of \(t\) remove **exactly \(r\)** edges, reducing its degree \(k+r\) to \(k\). For a fixed new column \(k+t\), the \(k-r\) values of \(s\) add **exactly \(k-r\)** edges, increasing its degree from \(r\) to \(k\). Columns \(0,\ldots,r-1\) remain degree \(k\). All rows stay degree \(k\).

Therefore the final-block subgraph is \(k\)-regular and lies in \(B_{k+r,k}\). Together with the complete blocks of size \(k\), this produces a spanning \(k\)-regular subgraph of \(B_{n,k}\). \(\square\)

## Step 3: decompose the factor into perfect matchings

By the classical 1-factorization theorem for regular bipartite graphs (König's line-coloring theorem), every finite \(k\)-regular bipartite graph decomposes into \(k\) edge-disjoint perfect matchings. The constructed \(k\)-factor of \(B_{n,k}\), carried through the column reversal, lies inside \(G_{n;a,b}\).

Hence \(\lambda(G_{n;a,b})\ge k=\delta(G_{n;a,b})\). The reverse inequality is trivial since every perfect matching uses an edge at each vertex. This proves the theorem. \(\square\)

## Reproducibility and adversarial scope

The dependency-free script [\`experiments/interval_sum_factor_construct.py\`](../experiments/interval_sum_factor_construct.py) implements exactly the block lemma, checks every row and column has degree \(k\), checks every edge lies in the permitted band, and reverses columns to return a factor in the original sum graph. A separate SciPy [integral max-flow verifier](../experiments/test_interval_sum_factors.py) has tested all intervals through \(n=40\).

The new block construction has also been checked for every \(1\le k\le n\le69\), and the translated interval theorem for every interval through \(n=25\). These finite checks **do not** replace the proof.

## Important relationship to P003

**Do not conclude P003 from this theorem.** P003 allows only prime sums. The consecutive-interval assumption forces a very strong collection of neighboring band diagonals that is absent from the prime-sum graph.

The related "arbitrary allowed sums" statement is false: on two copies of \(\{0,1,2\}\), choose the allowed sum set \(S=\{1,3\}\). Then
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}
\]
has minimum degree 1 but no perfect matching, because rows 0 and 2 both have only column 1 available.

The proven result is a **structural control case**: full consecutive bands saturate minimum degree, sparse nonconsecutive sum sets need not, and prime-supported sets remain an arithmetic question.

## The theorem is stronger than a generic convex-neighborhood assumption

Even a bipartite graph whose adjacency matrix has **consecutive 1s in every row and every column** need not have a factor of its minimum degree. Consider
\[
M=\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&0&0&0\\
1&1&0&0&0\\
1&1&0&0&0\\
1&1&1&1&1\\
1&1&1&1&1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This matrix is **biconvex** in the displayed ordering: every row and column has a consecutive block of 1s. Its minimum row/column degree is 2. But the first three rows collectively see only the first two columns, violating Hall's condition. Thus it has **no perfect matching**, let alone two. The extra aligned *constant-diagonal interval* structure of \(G_{n;a,b}\) is essential to the proof, rather than arbitrary biconvexity alone.

## Novelty and research-priority warning

This theorem has a complete proof within this research notebook, but its **publication priority has not been established**. General \(k\)-factor existence, Toeplitz and consecutive-ones matrices, convex bipartite graphs, bounded-displacement permutations and banded matrix decompositions are classical topics.

**Publication judgment:** This is an elegant elementary lemma, but likely less intrinsically substantial than P010 and may well be a known special case of regular-factor results. Keep it as a proved unnumbered incubator result until a much deeper novelty audit, not as a new open problem.
