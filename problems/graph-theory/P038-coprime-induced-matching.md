# P038 — How large can an induced matching in the coprime graph be?

<!-- /DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->

Let $M(N)$ be the maximum number of disjoint pairs $(a_i,b_i)$ of distinct integers in $[N]$ with $\gcd(a_i,b_i)=1$ but with **all four cross-gcds greater than one** for every $i\ne j$.

## Research question

Determine the subexponential factor in $M(N)$ and classify its near-extremal prime-factor configurations. More sharply, is the logarithm of $M(N)$ within $O(\log T(N))$ of the best Bollobás set-pair upper bound, where

$$
T(N)=\max\left\{t:\prod_{i=1}^t p_i\le N^2\right\}?
$$

## Proved baseline

The [prime-support set-pair argument](../../theorems/P038-coprime-induced-matching-bollobas.md) establishes

$$
T(N)\log2-O(\sqrt{T(N)\log T(N)})\le
\log M(N)\le T(N)\log2.
$$

In particular,

$$
\log M(N)\sim 2\log2\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}.
$$

The proof combines the classical Bollobás inequality with an explicit blockwise-balanced partition of the first $t$ primes. These are internally proved statements, **not** certified new literature results. The proposed logarithmic-error improvement and extremal stability are not proved.

The exact arithmetic induced-matching asymptotic was not found in a targeted literature search, but the general set-pair mechanism is classical. The main remaining research issue concerns the fine cost of representing complementary set systems by integer prime products. **Historical novelty unverified. Editorial placement: The Seedbed.**
