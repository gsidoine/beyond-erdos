# P032 — Is the prime-sum bipartite diameter eventually seven?

<!-- DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->
> **Research question:** Does the bipartite graph on two copies of [n], joined when i+j is prime, have diameter exactly seven for all sufficiently large n?
> **Formulation:** candidate. **Novelty:** not certified; equivalent prime-difference coverage is close to established questions.
> **Verified/known progress:** The unique sum-two edge is a bridge; diameter seven reduces to two-prime difference witnesses in intervals and elementary connectivity.
> **Finite evidence:** Exact BFS checks of diameter for small n, using both an all-pairs routine and a bridge-eccentricity identity.

**Area:** prime number theory and graph metric geometry. **Status:** candidate with a strong predecessor/source gate.

## The question

Let B_n have vertices L_1,…,L_n and R_1,…,R_n, with L_iR_j an edge when i+j is prime.

**P032.** Does

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{diam}(B_n)=7}
$$

hold for every sufficiently large n? Is it already true for n≥8?

This is the **two-copy bipartite graph**, not the ordinary n-vertex prime-sum graph studied in Filz's Hamiltonicity conjecture.

## Rigorous structural reduction

Every prime sum is odd except 2, and the only edge of sum 2 is L_1R_1. Deleting this edge separates B_n into parity subgraphs:

- H_0: left odd indices and right even indices;
- H_1: left even indices and right odd indices.

These two graphs are isomorphic by swapping left and right. When each is connected, the bridge implies

$$
\mathrm{diam}(B_n)=2\,\mathrm{ecc}_{H_0}(L_1)+1.
$$

For n≥8, the vertex R_8 has distance at least 3 from L_1 because 1+8=9 is composite. All right-even vertices have a prime-sum neighbor by Bertrand's postulate. Consequently eccentricity 3 is equivalent to:

> For every odd a≤n, some even j≤n has both j+1 and j+a prime.

Equivalently, **every even gap d≤n−1 is realized as a difference of two primes** p and p+d with p−1 even and 2≤p−1≤n, plus the existing connectivity of the parity component. This is an interval-constrained prime-difference problem. It is not proved by Bertrand's postulate alone.

The [exact graph verifier](../../experiments/P032_prime_sum_diameter.py) checks finite instances, not the uniform prime-difference conjecture.

**Priority warning:** this question may be an elementary reformulation of already-studied prime-difference coverage. Establish independent mathematical significance before presenting it as a novel conjecture.
