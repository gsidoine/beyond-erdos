# P040 — Local resilience of coprime perfect matchings

<!-- DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->
> **Research question:** Does the local perfect-matching resilience of the even–odd coprime graph converge, and is its limit determined by finite-prime Hall obstructions?  
> **Formulation:** candidate. **Novelty:** unverified; the former conjecture of a 1/2 limit is disproved by explicit arithmetic Hall cuts.  
> **Verified/known progress:** A finite-prime conditional-density theorem gives limsup ρ_n ≤ 914/2145 < 1/2, refining a simple 7/15 obstruction.  
> **Finite evidence:** Exact rational sieve certificates and exhaustive Hall-obstruction values for n≤10; a concrete n=1155 obstruction.

<!-- /DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->

Let $B_n$ be the balanced bipartite graph between $E_n=\{2,4,\ldots,2n\}$ and $O_n=\{1,3,\ldots,2n-1\}$, joining $e\in E_n$ and $o\in O_n$ when $\gcd(e,o)=1$.

Define its degree-relative perfect-matching resilience by

$$
\rho_n=\min_{\substack{F\subseteq E(B_n)\\B_n-F\text{ has no perfect matching}}}
\max_{v\in V(B_n)}\frac{d_F(v)}{d_{B_n}(v)}.
$$

## Research question

**Does $\rho_n$ converge, and what determines its limiting value?** In particular, does it agree with the infimum of the finite-prime conditional-density Hall obstruction parameters developed in the [supporting theorem](../../theorems/P040-finite-prime-hall-obstructions.md)?

This is a quantitative arithmetic matching question about the exact degree-relative cost of an adversarial Hall violation. It is not merely the known existence of a coprime perfect matching.

## A disproved initial conjecture

An earlier formulation asked whether $\rho_n\to1/2$. A random nearly balanced Hall cut gives the general upper bound $\limsup\rho_n\le1/2$, but **that bound is not sharp for the coprime graph**.

**Theorem (finite-prime Hall cuts).** The [complete argument](../../theorems/P040-finite-prime-hall-obstructions.md) establishes

$$
\boxed{\limsup_{n\to\infty}\rho_n
\le\frac{914}{2145}
=0.426107\ldots<\frac12.}
$$

For an especially transparent example, let $S\subseteq E_n$ and $U\subseteq O_n$ consist of integers divisible by at least one of $3,5,7$. Both have $(19/35+o(1))n$ vertices. Deleting all coprime edges from $S$ to $U$ destroys every perfect matching by Hall's theorem, while every vertex loses at most $(7/15+o(1))$ of its original incident edges. This gives the elementary bound $\limsup\rho_n\le7/15$.

Sharper constructions select specified exact small-prime-divisibility patterns. Four primes yield $71/165$; five primes yield $914/2145$. The underlying theorem converts each finite-prime pattern into an exact rational upper bound using a nonuniform product measure on prime supports. The calculations are reproduced by [an exact certificate program](../../experiments/P040_sieve_hall_obstructions.py).

**These bounds are not claimed optimal.** The limit of $\rho_n$ may be smaller or may fail to exist. In particular, convergence to the finite-prime variational infimum has not been established.

## Exact finite Hall search

Hall's criterion reduces $\rho_n$ to minimizing, over nonempty $S\subseteq E_n$ and $T\subseteq O_n$ with $|T|=|S|-1$, the largest degree-relative deletion fraction resulting from removing all edges between $S$ and $O_n\setminus T$. The [exhaustive verifier](../../experiments/P040_coprime_matching_resilience.py) yields:

| $n$ | $\rho_n$ |
|---:|---:|
| 2 | $1$ |
| 3 | $2/3$ |
| 4 | $3/4$ |
| 5 | $3/5$ |
| 6 | $3/5$ |
| 7 | $1/2$ |
| 8 | $4/7$ |
| 9 | $1/2$ |
| 10 | $1/2$ |

The finite small-$n$ values do not predict the asymptotic behavior: fixed-modulus Hall obstructions only manifest their limiting proportions once the sample interval is sufficiently long.

## Literature and mathematical significance

- Carl Pomerance, [*Coprime Matchings*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07157) (2021), strengthens earlier work of Bohman–Peng on coprime interval matchings. Matching existence and certain Hall nonemptiness statements are established, but do not imply degree-relative resilience under arbitrary edge deletion.
- Sah and Sawhney, [*Enumerating coprime permutations*](https://doi.org/10.1112/mtk.12159) (2022), exploit small-prime signatures and robust matching/absorption methods for counting coprime permutations.
- The extremal theory of [nonuniform product-measure intersecting families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26521) provides relevant disjointness-measure comparisons, but is not asserted to determine the present Hall-resilience constant.
- General local matching resilience and adversarial edge-failure problems are established research areas; the present question fixes a specific arithmetic host graph.

**Editorial scope.** This problem remains in **The Acorns** in the sharpened form of a quantitative arithmetic Hall-resilience question. The disproved $1/2$ conjecture is preserved as a mathematical negative result rather than presented as open. Historical originality of the sharper formulation and finite-prime bounds requires further specialist review.
