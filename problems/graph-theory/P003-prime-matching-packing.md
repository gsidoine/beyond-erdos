**Area:** extremal graph theory, arithmetic graph factors  
**Status:** candidate conjecture; novelty and unresolved status unverified  
**Proposed:** 28 October 2026

## Definition

Let $P_{2n}$ be the prime-sum graph from P002. Let $\delta_n$ denote its minimum degree, and let $\lambda(n)$ be the maximum number of pairwise **edge-disjoint perfect matchings** in $P_{2n}$.

Necessarily $\lambda(n)\le\delta_n$, since every perfect matching uses one edge at every vertex.

## Main conjecture

$$
\boxed{\lambda(n)=\delta_n\text{ for every }n\ge1.}
$$

Equivalently, is there a spanning $\delta_n$-regular subgraph of $P_{2n}$? This equivalence is exact: any union of $k$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings is a $k$-factor; a $k$-regular bipartite graph admits a decomposition into $k$ perfect matchings.

The prime number theorem gives $\delta_n\sim 2n/\log n$, so a positive answer would imply $\lambda(n)\sim 2n/\log n$.

## Exact flow formulation

Write $U$ for the odd vertices and $V$ for the even vertices, so $|U|=|V|=n$. By integral max-flow/min-cut, a spanning $k$-factor exists exactly when

$$
e(X,V\setminus Y)\ge k(|X|-|Y|)
$$

for **all** $X\subseteq U$ and $Y\subseteq V$. For a given $k$, use a flow network with source–$U$ capacities $k$, prime-sum edges capacity $1$, and $V$–sink capacities $k$.

The proposed conjecture is therefore an explicit arithmetic cut-expansion statement for $k=\delta_n$.

## Research directions

- Find a structured cut that disproves the conjecture.
- Prove suitable uniform edge-distribution/expansion bounds.
- Audit existing results on factors in arithmetic graphs.
- Reproduce numerical max-flow tests with a committed script, exact input values and full output logs.

## Evidence and novelty

Earlier exploratory tests were reported, but the numerical claims are deliberately **not** included as verified evidence in this entry until independently reproduced in committed code. No comprehensive novelty audit has been completed.

## Cross-problem literature review (2026-10-28)

Prior work on prime-sum graph Hamiltonicity and explicit constructions of multiple matchings does not immediately give a minimum-degree factor packing. This is **not a certification of novelty or of unresolved status**. Read the [full P001–P008 audit](../../literature-audits/2026-10-28-comprehensive-P001-P008.md) before citing this question in a mathematical publication.
