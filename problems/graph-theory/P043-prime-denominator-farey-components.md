<!-- /DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->

For $N\ge2$, form the graph on reduced fractions $a/p$ with $1\le a<p\le N$ and $p$ prime. Join $a/p$ to $b/q$ when $|aq-bp|=1$. Let $C(N)$ denote the largest connected-component size.

**Question.** Determine the asymptotic order of $C(N)$.

## Known results

The [supporting theorem](../../theorems/P043-prime-denominator-farey-structure.md) proves that deleting $1/2$ leaves a forest. If $c(N)$ is the number of components and $T_2(N)$ counts twin-prime pairs $p,p+2\le N$, then

$$
c(N)=\sum_{p\le N}(p-1)-\pi(N)(\pi(N)-1)+2T_2(N).
$$

Every triangle contains $1/2$, with exactly two triangles per twin-prime pair. This is an exact structural reformulation and proves nothing about the infinitude of twin primes. Elementary component-size bounds are also established in the theorem note.

## Computation

An [exact graph verifier](../../experiments/P043_prime_farey_components.py) checks the structural identities, component sizes and forest assertion for finite $N$. The component of $1/2$ is largest in the tested range, but that finite statement is not a proof for all $N$.

## Related literature

The ordinary Farey graph and Stern–Brocot parent relation are classical. See [Farey graph background](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/miguellopez/2021/07/11/farey/) and Zaman, [*Farey fractions with prime denominators*](https://www.impan.pl/shop/en/publication/transaction/download/product/82971). Kushwaha–Sarma, [*Farey-subgraphs and Continued Fractions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14856), study a different Farey subgraph restriction.

Historical priority and the unresolved status of the precise maximum-component question require specialist comparison.
