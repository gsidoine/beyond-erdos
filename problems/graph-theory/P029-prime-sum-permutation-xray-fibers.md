# P029 — Reconfiguration of prime-supported permutation X-ray fibers

<!-- DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->

> **Formulation:** candidate. **Novelty:** high overlap risk: discrete tomography X-ray fibers.  
> **Verified/known progress:** No two-position swap can preserve a nontrivial exact sum multiset; an explicit prime-supported fiber with two members differs at four positions.  
> **Finite evidence:** Exhaustive prime-sum matching fiber enumeration for n≤13; dependency-free script.

**Area:** combinatorics, graph reconfiguration, discrete tomography. **Status:** candidate; specialist priority review essential.

## Exact fiber

Let S_n^prime={σ∈S_n: i+σ(i) is prime for every i∈[n]}. For σ∈S_n^prime define its full **prime anti-diagonal histogram**

$$
c_q(\sigma)=\#\{i\in[n]:i+\sigma(i)=q\}
$$

for every prime q≤2n. Given a realizable histogram c, let F_{n,c} consist of the permutations with that histogram. Let R_{n,c}^{(r)} have vertices F_{n,c}, with two states joined if they differ at at most r positions (a simultaneous reassignment of their values at those positions).

**P029.** Is there an absolute r such that every nonempty F_{n,c} is connected in R_{n,c}^{(r)}, uniformly for all n? If not, determine the growth of the smallest sufficient move size r(n).

## A rigorous obstruction and witness

A nontrivial two-position swap changes values a,b assigned to two distinct positions i,j. Its two sum labels change from {i+a,j+b} to {i+b,j+a}. Equality of these two **multisets** forces either a=b or i=j. Hence no such move preserves a fiber for distinct positions and values.

For n=4, the two different valid prime-sum permutations

$$
\sigma=(2,3,4,1),\qquad\tau=(4,1,2,3)
$$

both have histogram {3,5,5,7}; they differ in **all four positions**. The fiber has exactly these two states, so the universal move size, if any, must satisfy r≥4. All these claims are independently enumerable.

**High redundancy risk:** a known Markov basis for the anti-diagonal permutation matrix fibers may settle bounded connectivity, either with or without prime restriction. Check toric presentations and the exact swap support before flagship promotion. There is no assertion that the restricted question is independently open.

## Finite cases and open questions

Compute R_{n,c}^{(3)}, R_{n,c}^{(4)}, … for the small fibers and test whether prime support requires larger moves than unrestricted tomography. Distinguish (i) preserving the X-ray after every move from (ii) merely preserving it at the endpoints.


## Relation to existing results

Anti-diagonal X-ray invariants and fiber moves are established objects of discrete tomography. The distinction of interest is the restriction to prime-supported permutations and the move size required within those fibers.
