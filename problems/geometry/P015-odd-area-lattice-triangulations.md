**Fields:** discrete geometry, lattice arithmetic, combinatorial reconfiguration  
**Status:** unproved candidate. Neither novelty nor unresolved status is certified.

## Geometry, parity, and the question

Let $P$ be a strictly convex polygon whose $n\ge4$ vertices $v_0,\dots,v_{n-1}\in\mathbb Z^2$ are listed cyclically (no three collinear). A **triangulation** uses diagonals between these vertices. Call it **odd-area** if, for every triangle with vertices $a,b,c$,

$$
\left|\det(b-a,c-a)\right|\equiv1\pmod2.
$$

This requires every triangle to have **odd normalized area**, i.e. an odd integer for twice the Euclidean area. Let $\mathcal T_{\mathrm{odd}}(P)$ denote the set of such triangulations. Join two states by an edge if a single usual diagonal flip transforms one into the other *and both triangulations remain odd-area*.

**P015.** Suppose the vertices of $P$ represent **all four** residues in $(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^2$, and $|\mathcal T_{\mathrm{odd}}(P)|\ge2$. Must the odd-area flip graph be connected?

A broader structural task is to classify the connected components and, if connected, bound the diameter as a function of $n$. The exact polygon coordinates may matter less than their mod-2 residue sequence.

## Two exact elementary propositions

**Proposition 1 (arithmetic-to-color translation).** Three distinct lattice vertices form a triangle of odd doubled area **if and only if** their reductions modulo 2 are **three distinct** elements of $\mathbb F_2^2$.

*Proof.* Reducing the determinant modulo 2, its value is nonzero exactly when the two difference vectors are linearly independent in $\mathbb F_2^2$. In the affine plane of order 2, any three distinct points are affinely independent, while any repeated class makes two differences linearly dependent. $\square$

Thus the full parity-area problem is equivalently one of triangulations of a convex polygon whose vertices are precolored with four colors, requiring every triangular face to have three **different** colors.

**Proposition 2 (flippability criterion).** In an odd-area triangulation, a diagonal bordering a convex quadrilateral is flippable within the odd-area state space **if and only if** the quadrilateral's four vertices have **all four** different mod-2 residues.

*Proof.* If the diagonal is $ac$ in cyclic quadrilateral $a,b,c,d$, the two current triangles force the colors of $a,c$ to be distinct and each of the colors of $b,d$ to differ from those of $a,c$. The other diagonal $bd$ gives two valid triangles exactly if $b,d$ differ as well; equivalently all four colors occur. $\square$

**Immediate obstruction.** If exactly three parity classes occur, **no** valid flip is possible. Hence two or more valid triangulations in such a three-color configuration always give a disconnected flip graph. One explicit six-vertex coloring is $(0,1,0,2,1,2)$, where there are exactly two odd-area triangulations and no valid flip.

**Realizability.** Any prescribed cyclic four-color pattern can be realized by the mod-2 residues of vertices of a sufficiently large strictly convex lattice polygon: choose a large-scale regular polygon in $\mathbb R^2$, then perturb/round each vertex to a nearby lattice point in its prescribed parity class. Bounded perturbations preserve strict convexity for sufficiently large scale. Thus the combinatorial four-color question is not artificially broader than the geometric lattice formulation.

## Exact finite falsification

The dependency-free program [`experiments/P015_odd_area_flip_graph.py`](../../experiments/P015_odd_area_flip_graph.py) enumerates all triangulations of the convex $n$-gon, all precolorings up to global color relabeling (restricted-growth strings), filters for odd-area faces, and constructs adjacency by a single diagonal flip.

| $n$ | Four-class patterns with at least two valid triangulations (mod global color relabeling) | Disconnected flip graphs |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | 5 | 0 |
| 6 | 20 | 0 |
| 7 | 70 | 0 |
| 8 | 231 | 0 |
| 9 | 735 | 0 |

Additional random precolorings at $n=10$ and $11$ yielded no disconnected examples. These checks are finite and are **not** a general connectivity proof.

**Crucial contrast:** If at most three residue classes are present, nontrivial state spaces can be totally disconnected. The **four-residue** hypothesis is therefore essential.

## Why a solution would matter

This problem links lattice determinants to a constrained associahedron (a subgraph of the ordinary flip graph). A positive theorem would classify when an arithmetically defined family of planar triangulations remains locally reconfigurable, potentially with a canonical-form or shellability argument. A negative theorem would exhibit a new parity-driven obstruction and could suggest new invariants of constrained triangulations.

It is also a test of the general Meta Erdős theme that a feasible combinatorial state space may not be connected by natural local moves.

## Direct and potentially subsuming prior art

- Baur, Bergerova, Voon and Xu, [*Flip graphs of coloured triangulations of convex polygons*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06546) (2024; 2025 publication), study colored flips of triangles and their connected components. **Their colored flips are not automatically the same as our fixed vertex-color, odd-area-preserving diagonal flips.**
- Acharya, Mütze and Verciani, [*Flips in colorful triangulations*](https://doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v16i1a9) (2025), obtain connectedness/Hamiltonicity for vertex coloring constraints, including certain arbitrary **two-color** patterns. Their permitted faces are not the same three-distinct-out-of-four condition.
- Debrohim, Sasaki and Nunes, [*Cyclically Colored Triangulations: Enumeration and Connectedness of Reconfiguration Graphs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.26006) (August 2026), prove connectivity of valid flips for **cyclically repeated colors** with at least four colors. **This is the most serious near-predecessor:** our arbitrary mod-2 parity sequences need not be cyclic repetitions, and an exact equivalence has not been verified.
- Lawson's classical connectivity theorem for unrestricted triangulation flip graphs does not survive arbitrary hard constraints.

**Novelty status:** *apparently distinct after targeted searching*, but no genuine originality certification. Before presenting P015 as a newly posed open problem, check whether general arbitrary-vertex-color "rainbow triangulation" connectivity is already solved or follows from the 2026 cyclic-color theorem.

### Source-level boundary clarified, 29 October 2026

The **2025 arbitrary-pattern colorful-triangulation result** of Acharya–Mütze–Verciani concerns **two vertex colors** and requires each face to contain **both colors**. It does not directly address a face requiring **three different colors among four fixed colors**. The **2026** Debrohim–Sasaki–Nunes theorem *does* use the three-distinct-color face condition, but establishes connectivity for **cyclically repeated colorings**, not explicitly for arbitrary patterns in the accessible abstract. This is the unresolved historical boundary, not a claim that all colored triangulation reconfiguration is new.

See the [source-level comparison](../../audits/2026-10-29-P015-P016-P018-P020-source-comparison-and-P010-snapshot.md). No complete full-text proof comparison with the 2026 preprint was possible during this pass.

## Next falsification, without a proof-first agenda

1. Exhaustively verify the graph for every four-color pattern with $n=10$ using dynamic state-space enumeration and color-class/dihedral symmetries.
2. Search for configurations that have a frozen triangulation despite using four parity residues.
3. Read the proof in Debrohim–Sasaki–Nunes (2026), specifically whether the cyclic hypothesis is essential or merely expositional.
4. If connectedness is already known, retain the arithmetic translation as a note and **demote** the conjecture rather than claim novelty.
