# P041 — Random-order divisibility chains

<!-- DOSSIER-SUMMARY -->

## Problem

Let $\sigma_N$ be a uniformly random permutation of $[N]$. Denote by $D_N$ the greatest $r$ for which there are indices $i_1<\cdots<i_r$ with

$$
\sigma_N(i_1)\mid\sigma_N(i_2)\mid\cdots\mid\sigma_N(i_r).
$$

Let $S_N$ be the corresponding maximum when all selected entries are squarefree. Define

$$
Z_N=\frac{(D_N-S_N)(\log\log N)^2}
{\log N\,\log\log\log N}.
$$

**Question.** Does $Z_N$ converge in probability to a constant?

## Known results

The [supporting theorem](../../theorems/P041-random-order-divisibility-gap.md) proves that $D_N$ and $S_N$ have the same first-order asymptotic $\log N/\log\log N$. Nevertheless, for every $\varepsilon>0$,

$$
\Pr(1-\varepsilon\le Z_N\le2+\varepsilon)\longrightarrow1.
$$

Thus the difference is of order $\log N\log\log\log N/(\log\log N)^2$ in probability. The theorem is proved internally, with the squarefree lower bound depending on the established Hegarty–Martinsson accessibility theorem for directed Boolean cubes. No limit for $Z_N$ is established.

## Reproducible finite cases

The [exact dynamic program](../../experiments/P041_random_divisibility_order.py) computes both chain lengths for any supplied permutation and checks its implementation against an independent exhaustive subsequence search on small cases. Finite random samples concern numerical behavior only and do not establish concentration or asymptotic laws.

## Relation to earlier work

Random arithmetic-progression subsequences were analyzed by Goh and Zhao, *Arithmetic subsequences in a random ordering of an additive set*, *Integers* **21** (2021), #A89 ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12339)). They involve a different relation and have leading constant $2$.

Squarefree divisor intervals are Boolean lattices. The squarefree proof uses Hegarty and Martinsson, *On the existence of accessible paths in various models of fitness landscapes*, *Annals of Applied Probability* **24** (2014), 1375–1395 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1214/13-AAP949)). The dimension of the divisibility poset is studied by Lewis and Souza, *Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A* **179** (2021), 105391 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2020.105391)); it is not the random-order statistic here.

Historical novelty of the precise gap question has not been certified.
