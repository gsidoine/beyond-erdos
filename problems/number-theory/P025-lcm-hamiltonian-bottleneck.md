**Area:** multiplicative combinatorics, Hamiltonian graph theory, extremal permutations. **Status:** candidate.

## Definition

For \(T\ge1\), let \(L_N(T)\) be the graph on \([N]\) with distinct \(a,b\) adjacent exactly when \(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\le T\). Define

$$
\Lambda(N)=\min_{\text{cyclic permutations }(a_1,\ldots,a_N)}
\ \max_{1\le i\le N}\operatorname{lcm}(a_i,a_{i+1}),
\qquad a_{N+1}=a_1.
$$

(For \(N<3\), make no cycle claim.) Put \(t_N=\Lambda(N)/N\).

**P025 (cyclic-only residual question).** Does the cyclic bottleneck satisfy \(\Lambda(N)\sim N^2/(4\log N)\), matching the **already known 1983 linear-path optimum**? More generally, determine the cyclic-to-linear bottleneck ratio and its exact finite behaviour. **Do not state the corresponding path asymptotic as a conjecture.**

**Major close predecessor:** Erdős–Freud–Hegyvári (1983), Theorem 1, already proves that the *linear* analogue has exact asymptotic \((1+o(1))N^2/(4\log N)\). The corresponding sequence is [OEIS A064764](https://oeis.org/A064764). Whether requiring the closing edge is a genuinely independent asymptotic problem must be audited before flagship promotion.

## A rigorous nontrivial lower bound

Let \(P_N\) be the primes in \((N/2,N]\), with \(r=|P_N|=\pi(N)-\pi(N/2)\). Suppose a Hamiltonian cycle uses only edges of lcm at most \(tN\), with \(t<N/4\). No two distinct vertices in \(P_N\) can be adjacent because their lcm is their product \(>N^2/4>tN\).

For any \(q\in P_N\) and neighbor \(m\ne q\), \(m\) cannot be a multiple of \(q\) within \([N]\), hence \(\operatorname{lcm}(q,m)=qm\) and \(m\le tN/q<2t\). Therefore all \(2r\) cycle edges incident with \(P_N\) must meet the fewer than \(2t\) vertices \(m<2t\). Each such vertex has only two cycle edges, so \(2r\le 4t\) and \(t\ge r/2\).

If instead \(t\ge N/4\), that bound is even stronger asymptotically. By the prime number theorem \(r\sim N/(2\log N)\), so in all cases

$$
\boxed{t_N\ge(1+o(1))\frac{N}{4\log N}.}
$$

The trivial upper bound is \(t_N\le N\), since \(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\le ab\le N^2\). This is an *elementary rederivation* of the lower scale of the 1983 path theorem, **not a new lower bound**. The 1983 theorem gives the same first-order value for the path optimum; the remaining question is the cost of closing the cycle.

## Prior art and precise distinction

- [Melotti–Saias, *On path partitions of the divisor graph* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.4064/aa190516-10-9): divisibility and path partitions, not a Hamiltonian **lcm bottleneck**.
- [McNew, *Permutations and the divisor graph of [1,n]* (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1112/mtk.12177): arithmetic permutation/divisor graph results; check exact paper theorem before claiming independence.
- [Erdős–Freud–Hegyvári, *Arithmetical properties of permutations of integers* (1983)](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1983-02.pdf): **high-risk predecessor** concerning adjacent gcd/lcm extremal functionals. **Direct confirmed predecessor:** Theorem 1 establishes the exact first-order optimal value for **linear paths**. It does not in its displayed statement include the closing edge of a cycle. This makes the cyclic distinction narrow and susceptible to easy reduction.
- [P010 submitted manuscript](../graph-theory/P010-minimum-coprime-adjacencies.md): counts coprime transitions, not the maximal adjacent lcm along a **cycle**.

**Priority status:** **confirmed direct collision for the linear analogue**, with only the cyclic-endpoint strengthening presently surviving. Do **not** promote until checking the original 1983 construction and whether it can be closed with no asymptotic cost. The counting lower bound is elementary and not a novelty claim.

## Next falsification gate

Compute \(\Lambda(N)\) exactly for small \(N\) by sorting distinct lcm edge weights and testing Hamiltonian cycles, with integer exactness and solver certificates. Compare Hamiltonian paths versus cycles; test whether the lower-order answer can be read directly from a known adjacent-lcm extremal theorem. If known, preserve ID as a historical note rather than claim an original problem.

## Revision history

- 2026-10-29: Proposed. Same-day primary-source check finds the linear path asymptotic **already proved** by Erdős–Freud–Hegyvári, Theorem 1; reframed as cyclic-only residual question and corrected McNew DOI.
