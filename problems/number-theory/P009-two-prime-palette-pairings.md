# P009 — Can prime-sum pairings use only two prime values?

**Area:** additive number theory, extremal arithmetic matchings  
**First proposed:** 2026-10-28  
**Status:** candidate problem, **unresolved and originality status unverified**  
**Relationship:** quantitative dual to P001 (maximize the number of colors vs. minimize the number).

## Statement

For a perfect matching \(M\) of \(\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}\) in which every matched pair has a prime sum, define its **prime palette** as
\[
\mathcal P(M)=\{a+b:\{a,b\}\in M\}.
\]
Set
\[
\kappa(n)=\min_M|\mathcal P(M)|.
\]
Prime-sum perfect matchings exist by the classical Greenfield–Greenfield/Bertrand argument.

**Question.** Is
\[
\boxed{\kappa(n)\le2\quad\text{for every }n\ge1?}
\]

In fact, the computations support the sharper complete formula
\[
\kappa(n)=
\begin{cases}
1,&2n+1\text{ prime},\\
2,&2n+1\text{ composite}.
\end{cases}
\]

## Theorem 1: exact one-color classification

**Proposition.** \(\kappa(n)=1\) if and only if \(2n+1\) is prime.

**Proof.** The sum of all \(2n\) integers is \(n(2n+1)\). If all \(n\) pair sums equal one prime \(p\), then \(np=n(2n+1)\), hence \(p=2n+1\). Conversely, if \(2n+1\) is prime, the pairs \(\{i,2n+1-i\}\) for \(1\le i\le n\) use that single sum. \(\square\)

This proposition is elementary and **not claimed new**.

## Theorem 2: prime-difference certificate for two colors

**Proposition.** Suppose there exist odd primes \(q,p\) with
\[
3\le q\le 2n-1,\qquad p=2n+q.
\]
Then \(\kappa(n)\le2\). If \(2n+1\) is composite, then \(\kappa(n)=2\).

**Proof.** Pair the initial even-length interval \(\{1,\ldots,q-1\}\) by
\[
\{a,q-a\},\quad 1\le a\le(q-1)/2.
\]
Every such pair has sum \(q\). Pair the remaining even-length interval \(\{q,\ldots,2n\}\) by
\[
\{a,p-a\},\quad q\le a\le(p-1)/2.
\]
Every pair in the second interval has sum \(p\). Each integer is used exactly once, and both sums are prime. If \(2n+1\) is composite, Theorem 1 rules out one color. \(\square\)

Thus one concrete sufficient condition is that \(2n\) admit a representation as the **difference of two primes** \(p-q\), with the smaller prime \(q<2n\). This is a *short-prime-pair* strengthening of the classical 1905 **Maillet conjecture**, which only asks for a representation \(2n=p-q\) without our upper bound on \(q\). Our sufficient condition is **not** asserted necessary: other two-color matchings can exist with sums whose difference is not \(2n\).

## Exact finite tests

A sieve-generated certificate \(q\) as in Theorem 2 exists for **every \(2\le n\le100{,}000\)**. The case \(n=1\) is handled by Theorem 1. For cases with \(2n+1\) prime, the one-color theorem of course suffices; the sieve also finds a two-prime certificate when \(n\ge2\). A fixed implementation is in [`experiments/two_prime_palette.py`](../../experiments/two_prime_palette.py).

| \(n\) | Prime \(q\) | Prime \(p=2n+q\) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 3 | 11 |
| 7 | 3 | 17 |
| 12 | 5 | 29 |
| 57 | 13 | 127 |
| 100 | 11 | 211 |
| 1,000 | 3 | 2,003 |
| 10,000 | 11 | 20,011 |
| 100,000 | 3 | 200,003 |

The largest *least qualifying prime* \(q\) among tested \(n\) was \(379\), attained at \(n=90{,}407\). All tests are **finite**, with no implication of an unconditional theorem for every integer.

## Novelty and difficulty audit

- Lawrence E. and Stephen J. Greenfield, [*Some Problems of Combinatorial Number Theory Related to Bertrand's Postulate*](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/green.html), *Journal of Integer Sequences* 1 (1998), prove the baseline pairing.
- [OEIS A000341](https://oeis.org/A000341) counts all prime-sum perfect matchings, rather than their minimum number of distinct sums.
- [OEIS A202472](https://oeis.org/A202472) counts primes \(q<2n\) for which \(q+2n\) is prime: **exactly the sufficient certificates in Theorem 2**. Thus the prime-pair input is emphatically *not a new number-theoretic problem*.
- János Pintz, [*On the difference of primes*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0149) (2012), studies differences of primes and their gaps; the classical Maillet conjecture concerns representation of all even integers as differences of primes.
- A [2018 Mathematics Stack Exchange discussion](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3031150/pair-up-1-2n-that-the-sums-of-each-pair-are-different-primes) asks the *opposite*, maximally many distinct prime sums, closely related to P001, not the two-color problem.

**Verdict:** the "two prime values" pairing formulation was not located in this targeted search, but its best simple sufficient condition is an explicit known prime-difference problem. Do not claim a fresh arithmetic breakthrough from Theorem 2 or the finite checks. An external specialist novelty review remains necessary.

## Next mathematical attacks

1. Characterize two-color matchings directly via the union of two reflection matchings (paths and even cycles), without presupposing \(p-q=2n\).
2. Determine whether the two-color statement can be reduced to a theorem *strictly weaker* than Maillet's prime-difference conjecture.
3. Search for counterexamples where the short prime-pair certificate fails but a more complicated two-color pairing survives.
4. Study the number of possible prime palettes and the trade-off with P001's maximum spectrum.
