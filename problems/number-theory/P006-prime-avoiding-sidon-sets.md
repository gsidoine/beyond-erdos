## Definition

A finite set \(A\subseteq[1,N]\) is Sidon if all differences \(b-a>0\) with \(a<b\in A\) are distinct. This is equivalent to the usual distinct-unordered-pair-sums definition.

Call \(A\) *prime-difference-free* if no positive difference between its elements is prime. Define

\[
F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)=
\max\{|A|: A\subseteq[1,N] \text{ is Sidon and }
(A-A)\cap\mathbb P=\varnothing\}.
\]

Here \(\mathbb P\) denotes the positive primes, and only **positive** differences matter.

## Main question

**Determine the asymptotic order and leading constant of \(F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)\).** In particular,

\[
\text{is } F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)=(1+o(1))\sqrt N\;?
\]

This is a **question**, not an asserted conjecture. It may be false; even existence of a limiting leading constant is unverified.

## Elementary lower bound (rigorous)

**Proposition.**

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\le
\liminf_{N\to\infty}\frac{F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)}{\sqrt N}
\le \limsup_{N\to\infty}\frac{F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)}{\sqrt N}
\le 1.
\]

**Proof.** Let \(M=\lfloor N/2\rfloor\). Classical finite Sidon constructions give a Sidon set \(S\subseteq[1,M]\) of cardinality \((1-o(1))\sqrt M\). As \(S\) is Sidon, at most one pair in \(S\) has difference \(1\). Delete one endpoint of that pair if it exists, leaving \(S'\) with at least \(|S|-1\) elements and no difference \(1\). The set \(A=2S'\subseteq[1,N]\) is Sidon and all its positive differences are even and at least \(4\), hence composite. Thus \(|A|\ge(1-o(1))\sqrt{N/2}\). The upper bound follows immediately from the standard \((1+o(1))\sqrt N\) upper bound for Sidon sets. \(\square\)

## Certified small computations

We formulated the maximum problem as a **mixed integer linear program**. Binary \(x_a\) indicates \(a\in A\). Prime differences forbid \(x_a=x_b=1\). For every composite difference \(d\), auxiliary \(y_{a,a+d}\) must equal \(1\) whenever both endpoints are selected, and the sum of these auxiliary variables is at most \(1\). Translation invariance permits fixing \(x_1=1\).

All entries below were solved with status **optimal** (status 0, zero MIP gap); these are **finite values only**.

| \(N\) | \(F_{\neg\mathbb P}(N)\) |
|---:|---:|
| 12 | 3 |
| 18 | 4 |
| 24 | 4 |
| 30 | 5 |
| 36 | 6 |
| 42 | 6 |
| 48 | 7 |
| 54 | 7 |
| 60 | 7 |

One seven-element witness at \(N=48\) is

\[
A=\{1,7,21,25,37,46,47\}.
\]

Its positive differences are distinct and composite (or \(1\)); this witness is not presented as a new record for ordinary Sidon sets.

Reproducibility: [`experiments/prime_avoiding_sidon_milp.py`](../../experiments/prime_avoiding_sidon_milp.py) (requires NumPy + SciPy).

```sh
python experiments/prime_avoiding_sidon_milp.py --N 48 --seconds 60
```

Use only status 0 as an optimality certificate; status 1 can represent a time limit, in which case a feasible witness is merely a lower bound.

## Adversarial and literature notes

The lower bound arises simply from scaling classical Sidon sets; the new issue is whether one can mix residue classes while forbidding **all** prime differences without sacrificing a positive proportion of maximum cardinality.

This connects Sidon/Golomb-ruler extremal theory to prime-difference-avoiding sets. A targeted web search did not identify this exact extremal function, but many adjacent topics exist:

**No comprehensive novelty audit or proof of the proposed asymptotic has been completed.**

## Next work

1. Seek an upper bound strictly below \((1+o(1))\sqrt N\) or construct sets breaking \(1/\sqrt 2\) asymptotically.
2. Replace the generic MILP with an exact combinatorial search that scales to larger \(N\).
3. Investigate modular constructions (Bose–Chowla, Singer, Ruzsa) under prime-gap exclusions.
4. Audit additive-combinatorics literature for forbidden-difference Sidon families.

## Cross-problem literature review (2026-10-28)

Classical Sidon extremal theory gives benchmarks; no direct prime-difference-free extremal asymptotic was located in the targeted audit. This is **not a certification of novelty or of unresolved status**. Read the [full P001–P008 audit](../../literature-audits/2026-10-28-comprehensive-P001-P008.md) before citing this question in a mathematical publication.
## Discovery pass 4 follow-up (2026-10-28)

Further searches found no direct asymptotic formula under the names 'prime-free Golomb ruler', 'Sidon no prime differences' or 'composite Golomb-ruler distances'. This absence of a hit is **not** evidence of novelty. The current lower constant 1/sqrt(2) comes from an elementary dilation; the next substantive objective should be a genuinely stronger asymptotic bound. See the [dated detailed audit](../../literature-audits/2026-10-28-pass-4.md).
