## Definition

Let \(M\) range over perfect matchings of \(\{1,\dots,2n\}\) for which every paired sum \(a+b\) is prime. Such matchings exist, for example by a Bertrand-postulate induction. Put

\[
R(n)=\max_M |\{a+b:\{a,b\}\in M\}|,
\qquad
D(n)=\pi(4n-1)-1-R(n).
\]

Here \(\pi\) is the prime-counting function. The \(-1\) excludes the prime \(2\), which cannot be the sum of two *distinct* positive integers.

## Main question

**Is \(D(n)\) bounded as \(n\to\infty\)?**

A weaker question is whether \(R(n)\sim\pi(4n)\).

### Immediate obstruction

The sum \(3\) requires \(\{1,2\}\). The sum \(5\) requires \(\{1,4\}\) or \(\{2,3\}\). Both sums cannot occur in one perfect matching. Thus \(D(n)\ge1\) for \(n\ge2\).

## Rigorous partial result

**Proposition.** For any fixed \(0<\varepsilon<2\) and all sufficiently large \(n\), one can select pairwise vertex-disjoint pairs from \(\{1,\ldots,2n\}\) whose sums realize **every prime** in
\([\varepsilon n,(4-\varepsilon)n]\).

**Proof.** Any odd prime \(p\) in this interval has at least \(\varepsilon n/2-O(1)\) representations \(p=a+b\) with \(1\le a<b\le 2n\), uniformly in \(p\). For a fixed \(p\), these representation pairs are vertex-disjoint. By the prime number theorem there are only \(O(n/\log n)=o(n)\) target primes. Choose a representation for each target prime greedily. Previously chosen pairs use \(o(n)\) vertices, and can therefore block only \(o(n)\) of the \(\Omega(n)\) candidate pairs for the next prime. A disjoint choice always remains. \(\square\)

**The gap:** A partial matching realizing many sums need not extend to a *prime-sum perfect matching*. The completion problem is substantial.

## Next attacks

- Prove or refute a uniform bound on \(D(n)\).
- Search for small-prime incompatibilities and forced-pair obstructions.
- Investigate absorption, matching completion, or rainbow-matching techniques.
- Reproduce earlier exploratory optimization observations with published solver code before citing their numerical values.

## Novelty audit

Not completed. Check research on prime-sum partitions, rainbow perfect matchings, and arithmetic matchings. Do not present this as a certified new open problem.

## Cross-problem literature review (2026-10-28)

Greenfield–Greenfield (1998) establishes the prime-pairing foundation; see exact rainbow-matching connections in the audit. This is **not a certification of novelty or of unresolved status**.
