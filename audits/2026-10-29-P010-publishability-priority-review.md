# P010 publication-readiness assessment (29 October 2026)

**Scope:** inspect the internally published [exact P010 proof](../theorems/P010-exact-coprime-adjacencies.md); examine close historical results, current mathematical significance, and realistic journal routes. **No claim of formal referee verification or certified originality.**

## Verdict

**Mathematically:** credible and complete-looking exact extremal theorem, with explicit optimal constructions and an asymptotic coefficient. The proof uses elementary number theory and a novel-to-this-repository decomposition by largest prime factor, with interclass connections through the factors 2 and 3.

**Significance if historically new:** a **modest but real original note in arithmetic combinatorics**, rather than a major advance on a previously established open problem. The full exact value for every $n$ is more valuable than just the leading constant; the independent construction makes the result expository and reproducible. It concerns one natural, highly structured arithmetic graph family; a general transfer theorem would elevate its significance, but we should not require one before writing a concise note.

**Publishability if novel:** plausible as a focused approximately **4–8 page paper** in a journal that accepts original short contributions. Not ready to submit until a human mathematician has independently checked the theorem and deeper bibliographic verification is complete.

## Statement and the essential mechanism

Let

$$
h(n)=\min_{(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in S_n}
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathbf{1}_{\gcd(a_i,a_{i+1})=1}.
$$

Then for every $n\ge4$,

$$
h(n)=\pi(n)-\pi(n/2)+
\max\left\{1,
\left\lceil\frac{\pi(n/2)-\pi(n/3)}2\right\rceil\right\},
$$

and $h(1)=0,h(2)=1,h(3)=2$. Hence $h(n)\sim(7/12)n/\log n$.

The lower bound comes from isolated vertex $1$, primes greater than $n/2$, and leaves at primes in $(n/3,n/2]$ in the **noncoprime** graph. The upper bound is the difficult part: partition the integers by their largest prime factor, pair selected blocks through 3-multiples, and join all resulting even-ended paths through 2-multiples. The inequality $\pi(2x)\le2\pi(x)$ ($x\ge3$) supplies enough components for the endpoint capacities.

An informative comparison with general graph theory: the independence number of the noncoprime graph is exactly $\pi(n)+1$ (at most one member with any given smallest prime factor, achieved by the set $\{1\}$ together with all primes). Thus Gallai–Milgram's general path-cover bound gives $\mathrm{pc}(H_n)\le\pi(n)+1$, whereas this arithmetic theorem determines the exact smaller value $\mathrm{pc}(H_n)=h(n)+1$ and the asymptotic ratio $\mathrm{pc}(H_n)/\alpha(H_n)\to7/12$. The general theorem does not automatically yield the refinement.

## Proof audit — what was checked and what was not

1. The identity $h(n)=\mathrm{pc}(H_n)-1$ is correct.
2. Every prime in $(n/3,n/2]$ is a degree-one vertex (with sole neighbor $2q$) in the noncoprime graph. Isolated vertex and leaf counting needs the $\max(1,\lceil B_n/2\rceil)$ correction; this correctly handles $n=9,21$.
3. The largest-prime-factor classes induce cliques; small classes contain suitable even endpoints; intermediate classes have the stated three members when $n\ge12$.
4. The odd number of intermediate classes is repaired by attaching the leftover class to the class of 3 through a 3-divisible edge; no vertex is used twice.
5. The prime-counting inequality ensures there are enough two-even-ended units to absorb all one-ended prime classes.
6. The explicit $n=4,\ldots,11$ witnesses and the dependency-free constructor have passed finite checks through $n=10{,}000$ on repository CI.

These checks strongly support correctness. They **do not constitute independent human refereeing** or a full machine-formalized proof. A separate audit should especially check the statement and range of the prime-counting inequality and the correctness of the path-endpoint accounting.

### Publishing-policy review

- [*Discrete Mathematics*](https://shop.elsevier.com/journals/discrete-mathematics/0012-365X) accepts graph theory, combinatorics, and **Notes** (short research contributions). A suitable scope match; significance remains the editorial question.
- [*Journal of Integer Sequences*](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/) considers interesting new sequences, combinatorial interpretations, and exact formulas. Its current guidelines prohibit LLM-written manuscript **prose** but explicitly allow LLM-suggested proof approaches **with detailed attribution, human rewriting and checking**. The repository's raw AI-produced prose should not be submitted.
- [*The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics*](https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/about/submissions) has a high substantiality standard; it allows AI-aided arguments only with full independent human verification and human-authored presentation. This specialized theorem alone may not meet its editorial-interest threshold.
- [*INTEGERS*](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/submit.html) explicitly excludes research in which AI was used to generate mathematical content/code under the current submission policy; **not a suitable target for this project**.

The manuscript must transparently disclose AI involvement according to the target venue's policy. Rewriting alone does not erase mathematical provenance.

## Recommendation

**Preserve P010 as an internally resolved problem and a potential short paper.** Do not promote it to "certified novel" or invest heavily in extending it until an independent specialist has (a) reproduced the proof in their own reasoning and (b) carried out a citation-chain priority audit. The Meta Erdős project's immediate emphasis can remain on posing and screening new high-impact questions.
